#          Silver Mail Users Configuration (`users.yaml`)
# ===============================================================
#
# This file defines users and role-based mailboxes for each domain.
# Users are grouped by their domain, and role mailboxes allow multiple
# users to access shared email addresses (e.g., info@domain, support@domain).
#
# Example configuration:
# domains:
#   - domain: example.com
#     # Role mailboxes - shared email addresses accessible by multiple users
#     roles:
#       - name: info                    # Creates info@example.com
#         assigned_users:
#           - alice                     # alice can access info@example.com
#           - bob                       # bob can access info@example.com
#       - name: support                 # Creates support@example.com
#         assigned_users:
#           - alice
#           - charlie
#       - name: sales                   # Creates sales@example.com
#         assigned_users:
#           - bob
#     # Individual user accounts
#     users:
#       - username: alice
#       - username: bob
#       - username: charlie
#
#   - domain: another-domain.com
#     roles:
#       - name: contact
#         assigned_users:
#           - john
#           - jane
#     users:
#       - username: john
#       - username: jane
#
# Notes:
# - Each user gets their own personal mailbox (user_db_{userID}.db)
# - Each role mailbox gets its own database (role_db_{roleID}.db)
# - Users assigned to a role can read/send from that role's mailbox
# - Role names must be unique within each domain
# - Users must exist before being assigned to roles
